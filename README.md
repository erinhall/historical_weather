Hi, welcome to my first go project.  This code reads historical weather data from a csv and can give total average days of precipitaion or max temperature change for a given period.  Info is given as screen output in json

To call the functions in cli, use syntax below:

./historical_weather days_of_precip [city]
or
./historical_weather max_temp_delta [city, year, month]

The brackets and commas are optional, but spaces are not.

Thanks!
